  "The conversion loss report (ADR 0015's headline deliverable, finally
   assembled). The loss *producers* (frbrise, project, export, mapping) emit
   first-class loss diagnostics; this namespace aggregates them into the artifact
   an institution audits: a per-edge, per-category, **per-source-field** account
   of what a conversion did not carry across.

   It is the round-trip accounting ADR 0015 describes — for a source A converted
   through the pivot to a target B, *which of A's own fields survived*. It reads
   only the structural loss vocabulary (`:loss/*` detail), never documentary
   predicates, so it stays vocabulary-blind (ADR 0003).

   Honest scope: this reports the loss measured at both edges of one conversion.
   A *full* round-trip that re-imports B and diffs it against A needs a reverse
   importer (future); the per-field survival account here is the assemblable,
   institution-useful 90 %."

(defn conversion-report
  "Assemble the loss report for a conversion from its loss diagnostics — the

   export-edge loss (from the exporter result). Returns:

     {:total           N   ; loss *events* — diagnostics, summed across edges
      :distinct-losses N   ; distinct [subject source-field], deduped across edges

   `:total` and `:distinct-losses` differ on purpose (audit R3): the same native
   field can be lost at *both* edges — unmapped on import and again unexpressible
   on export — so it raises `:total` by two events but is one distinct loss. The
   per-edge totals are clean (a field is flagged at most once per edge); read
   `:total` as field×edge events, `:distinct-losses` (and `:source-fields`) as
   the deduplicated 'which of my fields didn't survive' answer.

   `opts` may carry `:records` (count) for context; it is echoed back under
   `:records`."
