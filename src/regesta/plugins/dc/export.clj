(ns regesta.plugins.dc.export
  "Canonical → Dublin Core (DCMES 1.1) XML exporter (WP-4) — the reverse of
   `regesta.plugins.dc`, closing the DC round-trip that ADR 0015 marked as future.

   With the importer this is the first spoke that goes *source → pivot → same
   source*, so the loss model can finally be exercised as a real round-trip: a DC
   record imported to the canonical floor and exported back, with the report
   accounting exactly what did not survive the trip.

   Two losses are inherent to the floor and surfaced at the export edge (ADR 0015):
   - the canonical vocabulary has a single `:canon/agent`, so the DC
     creator / contributor / publisher roles collapse — every agent is emitted as
     `dc:creator` and the role is unrecoverable (`:under-specified`);
   - likewise `dc:relation` and `dc:source` both import to `:canon/relation`, so
     export cannot tell them apart and emits `dc:relation`.
   The six DCMES elements with no canonical home (subject, type, …) were already
   dropped at import; they simply do not reappear — the round-trip's hard loss.

   Output is built as a string (correct XML escaping, a stable `dc:` prefix, the
   predefined `xml:` prefix for `xml:lang`) rather than via `data.xml/emit`, for
   the same reason `regesta.plugins.lrmoo.export` renders N-Triples directly: full
   control over the surface form. The result re-imports through
   `regesta.plugins.dc` (whose `rewrite-tags` keys on the namespace URI, not the
   prefix). Like the LRMoo exporter, this is kept out of the plugin map's
   `:exporter` slot to avoid a require cycle — wiring is a later assembly step."
