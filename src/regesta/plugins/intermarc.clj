  "INTERMARC-SRU importer (WP-4, ADR 0007).

   Parses BnF InterMARCXChange — the MARCXChange XML the BnF SRU API returns —
   into IR records carrying native `:intermarc/*` assertions. A focused parser
   (the structure is regular and known) rather than the generic shape adapter.

   Mapping:
   - one `<mxc:record>` → one Record, id `:bnf/<cb-number>` from its ARK,
     `:kind :intermarc/<type>` (e.g. `:intermarc/bibliographic`);
   - each `<controlfield tag=\"T\">` → `:intermarc/fT` = text;
   - each `<subfield code=\"C\">` of `<datafield tag=\"T\">` →
     `:intermarc/fT_C` = text (repeatable: one assertion per occurrence).

   Tags and subfield codes are numeric, so predicate *names* are prefixed `f`
   (`:intermarc/f145_3`): a keyword name may not start with a digit, and an
   un-prefixed `:intermarc/145_3` would not round-trip through EDN (ADR 0001).
   This subfield granularity is exactly what FRBRisation reads — `f145_3` is the
   embedded Work-authority link, `f100_3` the author's, `f245_a` the title.

   Like every plugin (ADR 0007) this exposes an `:importer` closure; the core
   never sees `:intermarc/*`. Indicators and the leader are not yet captured
   (a later refinement).

   The MARCXML field/subfield parse lives in `regesta.plugins.marcxml` (shared
   with the MARC21 spoke); this namespace supplies only the INTERMARC policies:
   a record is an `<mxc:record>` (a `record` carrying the `id` ARK, vs the SRU
   `<srw:record>` wrapper that has none), its id is `:bnf/<cb-number>`, and its
   `:kind` comes from the `type` attribute."

            [regesta.plugins.marcxml :as marcxml]))

(def mapping
  "INTERMARC→canonical mapping for the bibliographic core. INTERMARC reaches the
   WEMI pivot through the *enriched* `frbrise` rung (the 145 $3 authority link),
   not the floor projection — but populating `:canon/*` too lets the round-trip
   exporters (DC, MARC21) and the Linked Art creator read off it. The agent is the
   *controlled* 100 main entry, **recombined declaratively** from its subfields —
   `$a` (surname) + `$m` (forename), catalog form \"Surname, Forename\" — by a
   `:mapping/combine` rule, not the transcribed 245 $f responsibility statement
   (which can be compound — multiple names and roles). The 100 authority link
   (BnF id / ISNI) is not carried: the floor is string-only (ADR 0003); that
   identity lives on the enriched `frbrise` rung."
