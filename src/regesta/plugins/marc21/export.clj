(ns regesta.plugins.marc21.export
  "Canonical → MARC21 (MARCXML) exporter (WP-4) — the reverse of
   `regesta.plugins.marc21`, closing the MARC21↔LRMoo round-trip (a V1 acceptance
   criterion) and, with it, the loss-aware account of what the *pivot* costs MARC.

   The pivot is the canonical floor, not MARC. MARC21 ingest is lossless (every
   field retained as `:marc21/*`), but only the bibliographic subset is lifted to
   `:canon/*`; so a round-trip *through the pivot* reconstructs only that subset.
   This exporter rebuilds MARCXML from `:canon/*` alone, and the loss report
   accounts the whole gap (ADR 0015):

   - **import edge, `:dropped`** — every native MARC field the floor never carried
     (subjects 6xx, physical 300, the leader/008, …): `pivot-dropped-*`. This is
     the floor's MARC coverage gap, measured per field against the retained
     natives — the MARC analogue of the Dublin Core spoke's report-at-ingest loss.
   - **export edge, `:under-specified`** — the many-to-one collapses the floor
     imposed (5 agent fields → one `:canon/agent`; 010/020/022/035 → one
     `:canon/identifier`; …): the original MARC tag is not recoverable.

   Output is a `<record>` string in the MARC21slim namespace (correct XML
   escaping), re-importable through `regesta.plugins.marc21`; `001` is emitted
   from the record's `:source` (its original control number) so the trip is
   id-stable. Indicators were not captured at ingest, so blanks are emitted. Like
   the LRMoo/DC exporters this is kept out of the plugin `:exporter` slot to avoid
   a require cycle — wiring is a later assembly step."
