(ns regesta.plugins.shape
  "XML shape adapter — walks a parsed XML source tree and produces an
   IR Record per a plugin's mapping (ADR 0009). Sole V1 producer of
   fragments: the rule layer cannot mint them (ADR 0011 §Limitation),
   so the canonical normalization in M4 assumes the shape adapter has
   already laid down references and fragment-level coords in the
   native vocabulary.

   The walker `ingest-xml` consumes XML elements as produced by
   `clojure.data.xml`. It is mapping-driven: it acts only on the
   predicates a plugin's mapping mentions, and consults
   `:mapping/qualifier` to decide which paths mint fragments. Dublin
   Core (`regesta.plugins.dc`) is the V1 consumer; it wraps `rewrite-tags`
   + `ingest-xml` in its own importer.

   ## XML convention

   - Caller supplies an already-parsed XML element (the output of
     `clojure.data.xml/parse-str` or equivalent). The walker uses
     `:tag` and attribute keys as-is — whatever keyword form the
     parser produced is what ends up in fragment ids and assertion
     predicates.
   - `clojure.data.xml/parse-str` by default produces URI-encoded
     keyword namespaces (`:xmlns.http%3A%2F%2F.../title`). For
     human-inspectable fragment ids, callers pre-process the parsed
     tree with `rewrite-tags` to a clean namespaced form (e.g.
     `:dc/title`). The walker stays format-agnostic by accepting
     whichever keyword form the caller normalizes to.
   - The top-level element is the record root; its child elements
     are predicates. Each child's `:tag` is the predicate keyword.
   - Multiplicity: repeated child elements with the same tag
     contribute one occurrence each, in document order.
   - Flat values use the element's text content (the concatenation of
     string children of `:content`).
   - Qualified values use the element's attribute named by the
     mapping's `:mapping/qualifier :from` for the qualifier, and the
     text content for the main value. Missing attribute → fragment
     without qualifier coord; missing text → fragment without value
     coord. Mixed content (text interleaved with nested elements) is
     V1-lossy: only the string children of `:content` are kept.
   - Whitespace preservation: text content is returned verbatim,
     including leading/trailing whitespace from XML indentation.
     `<dc:title>\\n  Les Misérables\\n</dc:title>` ingests as the
     literal `\"\\n  Les Misérables\\n\"`. To normalize it, declare
     `:mapping/transform [:trim]` on the mapping; the shape adapter
     never trims at ingest (XML carries whitespace as data —
     `xml:space=\"preserve\"` is part of the spec — so the ingest
     layer stays faithful and the `:normalize` phase is the correct
     home for format-normalizing transforms, ADR 0004).

   ## Fragment minting (M1, ADR 0012)

   Fragment ids come from `regesta.model/mint-fragment-id`. The
   locator is `[predicate idx]` where `idx` is the occurrence's
   position in document order at that predicate. Within a predicate
   the order is preserved by construction (XML `:content` preserves
   SAX order).

   ## Out of scope (V1)

   - Deep nesting (CIDOC-style multi-level fragments). Locators are
     two-segment `[predicate idx]` only; richer nesting waits for a
     concrete plugin need.
   - XML root-attribute extraction. The caller sets `:record-id` and
     `:kind` explicitly.
   - Diagnostic emission for shape mismatches (a flat mapping seeing
     a sub-element, or a qualified mapping seeing an element with no
     attribute, etc.). Silent skip in V1; revisit if a plugin author
     reports confusion."
