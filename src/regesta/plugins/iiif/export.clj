(ns regesta.plugins.iiif.export
  "Canonical → IIIF Presentation 3.0 manifest exporter (WP-4) — the reverse of
   `regesta.plugins.iiif`, closing the **fifth and final** spoke round-trip (source
   manifest → canonical floor → manifest), after DC, MARC21 and MODS.

   IIIF describes a *digitised object*, so its floor mapping is the narrowest of the
   spokes: only `:canon/title` (→ `label`), `:canon/identifier` (→ the manifest
   `id`), `:canon/digital-object` (→ the `Image` bodies painted on canvases) and
   `:canon/note` (→ `summary`). The exporter rebuilds exactly that manifest tree,
   and the loss report (ADR 0015) accounts the gap:

   - **export edge, `:dropped`** — the floor predicates IIIF has no home for. A
     manifest carries no bibliographic creator or date, so `:canon/agent` and
     `:canon/date` (and any other non-IIIF floor predicate) cannot be expressed and
     are dropped. This is IIIF's floor-coverage gap, the converse of the importer's
     report-at-ingest.
   - **export edge, `:under-specified`** — `summary` and `metadata` both collapsed
     onto `:canon/note` at import; on export notes are emitted as `summary` (a
     single, display-only field the importer reads first-language), so the
     summary/metadata distinction — and, for more than one note, the surplus — is
     not recoverable.

   Output is a Presentation 3.0 manifest (`clojure.data.json`, slashes unescaped so
   URIs stay readable), re-importable through `regesta.plugins.iiif`; the manifest
   `id` comes from `:source` (the original manifest URI) so the trip is id-stable.
   Synthesised canvas/annotation ids are derived from that base and are ignored by
   the importer (which reads only the `Image` body ids), so the trip is idempotent.
   Kept out of the plugin `:exporter` slot to avoid a require cycle — wired by
   `regesta.convert`."
