(ns regesta.plugins.mods.export
  "Canonical → MODS (LoC) exporter (WP-4) — the reverse of `regesta.plugins.mods`,
   closing the **third** spoke round-trip (source MODS → canonical floor → MODS),
   after Dublin Core and MARC21. With the importer it lets the loss model be
   exercised as a real round-trip on a *nested* format.

   The pivot is the canonical floor, not MODS. MODS ingest lifts only the
   bibliographic core to `:canon/*`; a round-trip *through the floor* therefore
   reconstructs only that core, and the loss report accounts the gap (ADR 0015):

   - **export edge, `:under-specified`** — the many-to-one collapses the floor
     imposes. MODS distinguishes a `name` from an `originInfo/publisher` and an
     `abstract` from a `note`, but both pairs collapse onto one `:canon/agent` /
     one `:canon/note` at import; on export every agent is emitted as `<name>` and
     every note as `<note>`, and the distinction is unrecoverable.
   - **import edge, `:dropped`** — `titleInfo/subTitle` is captured natively
     (`:mods/subtitle`) but the floor has no home for it, so it never reaches
     `:canon/*` and does not survive the trip. (The unmodelled top-level elements —
     subject, language, physicalDescription… — were already reported as loss by the
     *importer* at ingest; they are not retained as assertions, so they surface
     there, not here.)

   Output is a `<mods>` document in the MODS v3 namespace (correct XML escaping),
   re-importable through `regesta.plugins.mods`; `recordInfo/recordIdentifier` is
   emitted from the record's `:source` so the trip is id-stable. Like the LRMoo/DC/
   MARC21 exporters this is kept out of the plugin `:exporter` slot to avoid a
   require cycle — wiring is the `regesta.convert` assembly step."
