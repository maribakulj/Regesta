  "Shared MARCXML parsing for the MARC-family spokes (INTERMARC, MARC21).

   MARCXChange (BnF) and MARC21slim (LoC) are the same XML shape — a `record`
   of a `leader`, `controlfield`s (`tag`) and `datafield`s (`tag` + `subfield`s
   keyed by `code`) — differing only in namespace, how a record is recognised,
   and how its id is derived. This namespace owns the common parse; each spoke
   supplies those three policies. Extracted when MARC21 became the second MARC
   parser, so the field/subfield logic lives once (audit R1's drift lesson).

   Elements are matched by **local name** (`(name (:tag elem))`) and attributes
   by local name too, so whichever keyword form `clojure.data.xml` produced for a
   namespace — URI-encoded or aliased — is irrelevant. Predicate *names* are
   prefixed `f` (`:marc21/f245_a`): a keyword name may not start with a digit and
   an un-prefixed `:marc21/245_a` would not round-trip through EDN (ADR 0001)."
