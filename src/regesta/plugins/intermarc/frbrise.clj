  "INTERMARC → WEMI FRBRisation (WP-3, ADR 0016). A compiled `:infer` rule that
   reads `:intermarc/*` assertions and mints LRMoo entities, using the embedded
   authority link (the `f145_3` lookup validated in the WP-0 spike) — no fuzzy
   inference for authority-controlled records.

   This slice models the link the data carries directly:

     <mxc:record>                              -> F3_Manifestation (id from ARK)
     f145 ($m language, $3 authority id)       -> F2_Expression    (id from f145_3)
     R4_embodies                               Manifestation -> Expression

   So manifestations sharing an `f145_3` collapse to one Expression by id alone
   (ADR 0008) — lookup-based clustering, no batch state. The Work level (R3,
   from author + uniform title) and the fuzzy fallback for records without
   `f145` are a later slice (the spike showed the fallback needs bridging).
   Commit policy (D7, ADR 0014/0016): claims resting on a determinate identifier
   (the ARK, the `145 $3` link) are `:asserted` (certified); the Work whose
   creator is only a name string stays `:proposed`. The string-key floor
   projection (`lrmoo.project`) proposes everything.

   A `compiled-rule` (not a data rule): it computes content-derived ids, which
   the data DSL deliberately cannot express (the mapping compiler does the same)."
