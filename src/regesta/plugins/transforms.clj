(ns regesta.plugins.transforms
  "Core transform stdlib for the mapping schema (ADR 0009) and the
   plugin extension model (ADR 0010).

   A transform is a pure function `(fn [value] -> value-or-nil)`.
   Returning `nil` signals 'couldn't transform' — the surrounding
   mapping then decides what that means (skip, diagnose, or default
   per ADR 0009 §`:on-empty`).

   This namespace ships six core transforms:

   - `:trim`           — strip leading/trailing whitespace from strings
   - `:lowercase`      — locale-insensitive case folding (lower)
   - `:uppercase`      — locale-insensitive case folding (upper)
   - `:parse-int`      — string or number → long, nil on failure
   - `:parse-double`   — string or number → double, nil on failure
   - `:parse-iso-date` — accept ISO-8601 year / year-month / full date
                          forms; pass through; reject anything else

   Plugins extend the transform stdlib via their plugin map's
   `:transforms` key; pooling and conflict rules live in
   `regesta.plugins/effective-transforms`."
