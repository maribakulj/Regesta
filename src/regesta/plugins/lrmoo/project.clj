  "Canonical → WEMI projection — the *generic* pivot (ADR 0013 §2: the LRMoo
   plugin owns projection).

   It reads only the canonical floor (`:canon/agent`, `:canon/title`) and mints a
   WEMI graph, so **any** spoke that maps to canonical (via shape + mapping) gets
   an LRMoo view — not just INTERMARC. This is the two-rung ladder's graceful
   degradation (ADR 0013) made real: where `intermarc/frbrise` is the *enriched*
   projection that exploits the native `145 $3` authority link, this is the
   floor projection every format shares.

   Honest limits:
   - Canonical carries **no authority link**, so identity always falls back to the
     string key (creator + normalised title). That key under-merges title variants
     (measured: recall ~0.43, `docs/spikes/entity-resolution.md`) — the price of
     projecting from the floor.
   - WEMI needs an Expression to connect Work and Manifestation (LRMoo has no
     direct Work–Manifestation link); canonical gives nothing to characterise it
     (language/form), so a minimal Expression is minted to carry the chain.
   - Loss (ADR 0015, import edge): unrepresented `:canon/*` fields are `:dropped`;
     >=2 distinct languages (parallel-language titles = multiple Expressions) make
     the floor's single Expression `:under-specified` (ADR 0013 graceful
     degradation); an `uncertain` title collapsed to one alternative is
     `:ambiguity-collapsed`. Minted claims default to `:proposed` (ADR 0005)."
