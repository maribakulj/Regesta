  "RDF export of the LRMoo view (WP-2, ADR 0013). Renders a record's WEMI
   entities and their `:lrmoo/*` assertions as RDF — N-Triples for now (the
   canonical, line-based syntax). Turtle and JSON-LD are thin follow-ons over
   the same `triples` seq. Because local LRMoo names are the spec's own, class
   and predicate IRIs come straight from `lrmoo/iri`.

   `triples` yields the graph as data (`[s p o]`, `o` = `{:iri _}` | `{:lit _}`);
   `exporter` follows the ADR 0007 exporter contract. Three RDF serialisations
   render that one seq — N-Triples (canonical, line-based), Turtle (prefixed,
   grouped by subject) and compacted JSON-LD (web-native) — so the CRM
   down-projection and any future view reuse them by augmenting the seq first.
   The view exports the `:lrmoo/*` WEMI vocabulary **and** the `:crm/*` predicates
   the rich graph carries (typing CRM entities — agents `E21_Person`, subjects
   `E55_Type`/`E53_Place` — and their relations, e.g. `:crm/P129_is_about`), so the
   full entity graph reaches RDF, not just the WEMI chain; canonical/native
   predicates remain export loss until their own IRI mappings land. Wiring this into
   the LRMoo plugin map's `:exporter` is a later assembly step (kept out here to
   avoid a cycle with the vocabulary namespace)."
