(ns regesta.plugins.lrmoo.crm-import
  "CRM/LRMoo RDF → LRMoo view — the *upward* path (ADR 0019). The exporters
   `regesta.plugins.lrmoo.export` / `…lrmoo.crm` project the WEMI view *down* to
   RDF; this reads such RDF *back* into the LRMoo entities + WEMI relations.

   The whole point (ADR 0019): CRM → LRM is a **downcast**, and a downcast succeeds
   exactly when the specific type is still present. So for each node we take the
   **most specific** rdf:type available:

   - an LRMoo **F-class** IRI (`F1_Work`, `F2_Expression`, `F3_Manifestation`,
     `F5_Item`) ⇒ recovered unambiguously — the additive `:crm`/`:lrmoo` export keeps
     these, so the trip is lossless;
   - failing that, a CRM **E-class** super-class: `E89 → F1`, `E24 → F5` are 1:1 and
     recover; but `E73_Information_Object` is the super-class of *both* `F2` and
     `F3`, so a node typed only `E73` cannot be downcast — it is reported as an
     `:ambiguity-collapsed` loss (ADR 0015). This is precisely the collapse the
     pure-CRM (`:crm-only`) export warned about in `crm/crm-only-losses`: the loss
     report of the down-projection *is* the spec of what the up-projection cannot
     recover.

   This is not wired as a documentary `convert` source — CRM is the hub-as-output,
   not a spoke. It exists to demonstrate the directionality rule on real data
   (`crm-import-test`): our own F-typed CRM round-trips to LRM; our flattened CRM
   does not."
