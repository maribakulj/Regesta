  "Additive CIDOC-CRM down-projection of the LRMoo view (museum spoke, ADR 0013;
   scoping in docs/museum-spoke-scoping.md).

   LRMoo's F-classes are subclasses of CRM E-classes and its WEMI relations are
   sub-properties of CRM P-properties, so a CRM serialisation is, *additively*,
   free: for every LRMoo type / relation triple we also emit its CRM super-type /
   super-property triple. The LRMoo triples are kept, so nothing is lost — an LRMoo
   consumer reads F/R, a plain-CRM consumer reads E/P.

   Honest limits (verified against LRMoo_v1.0.owl, hence why we do *not* replace):
   - `F2_Expression` and `F3_Manifestation` both subclass `E73_Information_Object`,
     so a CRM-only consumer cannot tell Expression from Manifestation by type;
   - the WEMI relations map to *generic* CRM properties (`P130_shows_features_of`,
     `P165_incorporates`, `P128_carries`), losing their WEMI-specific meaning.
   A lossy pure-CRM *replacement* (and the export-edge loss it would report) is a
   later slice; this one is the lossless additive view."
