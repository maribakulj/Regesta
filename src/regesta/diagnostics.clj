(ns regesta.diagnostics
  "Diagnostics API.

   Diagnostics are first-class IR citizens (ADR 0001): a validation rule
   produces a `Diagnostic` attached to its subject; the pipeline never throws
   to signal a data problem. This namespace provides the read-side of that
   model: filters, aggregations, human-readable reporting, and a failure
   policy for callers (CLI, CI) that need a yes/no answer.

   Inputs to most functions are diagnostic vectors (e.g. `(:diagnostics
   record)`); helpers `collect` and `collect-many` flatten a record or a
   collection of records into such a vector. Functions are pure and never
   mutate the underlying record."
