(ns regesta.convert
  "End-to-end conversion assembly (the institution-facing keystone): a source
   document in any supported spoke format → the WEMI/LRMoo pivot → a chosen target
   serialisation, with the ADR 0015 loss report over every edge.

   This is the namespace that wires the parts the rest of the system built and the
   convergence capstone proved compose: the five importers, the two projection
   rungs (INTERMARC's enriched `frbrise`, the floor `project` for the others), and
   the ten exporters. `convert` returns the output string plus the conversion
   loss report, in one call.

   Loss is collected at three points and merged: import-edge (a spoke's
   report-at-ingest, e.g. Dublin Core / MODS / IIIF unmodelled elements), the
   projection edge (canonical fields with no WEMI home, frbrise loss), and the
   export edge (what the chosen target cannot express). The per-edge, per-field
   account is exactly `regesta.loss-report`'s artifact."

   `{:records N :loss <conversion-report>}`.

   Constant memory in the corpus size: unlike `convert`/`to-wemi` (which `mapv` the
   whole corpus into a vector), this `reduce`s the record stream, holding one record
   at a time plus a loss accumulator bounded by the distinct fields/categories/edges
   (`regesta.loss-report/accumulate`), never by N. It is sound to stream because the
   Work-id convergence across records is carried by the content-derived ids
   (ADR 0008), not by a global clustering pass — per-record conversion has no
   cross-record state (roadmap §10, 'converter → store': Regesta streams the triples,
   a store deduplicates by id).

   Edge scope: folds the per-record **projection** and **export** edges. Import-edge
   (report-at-ingest) loss is the importer's separate output, which a record stream
   does not carry; so the streamed report's per-edge / per-category / per-field
   counts equal the batch report's **iff the importer emits no ingest loss** — which
   holds for every streamable spoke (the MARC family importers report none; pinned by
   `convert-stream-test`). For a hypothetical streamable spoke with report-at-ingest
   loss the streamed report would under-count the import edge — fold the importer's
   `:diagnostics` into the same accumulator then. `:distinct-losses` (O(N)) is always
   batch-only. Throws on an unknown `from`/`to`."
