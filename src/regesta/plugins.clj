  "Plugin protocol and registry.

   A plugin is a plain Clojure map (ADR 0007) carrying any combination
   of:

   - an `:importer` (external source → IR records),
   - a `:stream-importer` (a `Reader` → a *lazy* record seq, for WP-7 streaming),
   - an `:exporter` (IR records → external output),
   - `:rules` — rule-DSL data, schema in `regesta.rules` (ADR 0002),
   - a `:mapping` — data-shaped sugar over rules (ADR 0009),
   - `:predicates` / `:transforms` — stdlib extensions (ADR 0010),
   - declarations (`:requires`, `:input-format`, `:output-format`).

   Only `:plugin/spec-version` and `:id` are required; every other key is
   optional. The schema is closed: unknown keys are rejected so typos
   surface immediately. New optional keys must justify themselves
   through concrete plugin needs (growth discipline per ADR 0007).

   The registry is a plain immutable map `{plugin-id → plugin-map}`.
   `register` and `unregister` return new registries; multiple registries
   coexist freely (test fixtures, isolated runs).

   This namespace covers the schema, the registry data structure, and
   the inert query helpers (lookup, filter-by-format, pooling). The
   `:requires` resolution graph and the `:input-format` dispatch logic
   live in their own namespaces (Sprint 5 M2.B)."

;; Plugin schema
;;
;; Closed shape: every key is named here. The `:plugin/spec-version` field
;; is literal `1` for the current major revision; future incompatible
;; changes bump it, additive minor changes do not.
;;
;; `:rules` and `:mapping` are shallow-validated (`vector of maps`). Deep
;; validation lives with the relevant compiler — the rule compiler
;; (`regesta.rules`) and the mapping compiler (Sprint 5 M4). Keeping
;; this namespace independent of those compilers avoids a load-order
;; cycle and lets a plugin be inspectable without compiling anything.
