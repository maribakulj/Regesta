  "Cross-record agent reconciliation (ADR 0018, a first brick): given a batch of
   records, collapse the per-record identified-agent entities (`:crm/E21_Person`
   with an `:iri`) that share an authority identifier into one reconciled agent.

   This is reconcile-to-authority done *certified*: the blocking key is the
   authority id (an ISNI), so the dedup is exact and D7-`:asserted` — no string
   matching, no recall ceiling (contrast `docs/eval/entity-resolution.md`, where
   string keys under-merge). It is deliberately the *measured-true* path: where
   two records carry the same ISNI they are the same person, full stop; where they
   carry only a name string they are left unmerged (that is the ADR 0018 fuzzy
   tier, not done here).

   The output is the agent *store* — distinct agents, each with the records that
   mention it — not a rewrite of the records; merging records onto a shared agent
   node is a downstream step.

   The fuzzy tier (ADR 0018 decisions 3/4) is `propose-agent-links`: for agents
   that have only a *name* (no authority id), it proposes equivalences to an
   authority pool by name similarity — always `:proposed` (never `:asserted`,
   D7), confidence-scored and revisable. A match is `:certifiable?` only when the
   authority entry carries a determinate id; a perfect name match to an id-less
   entry (the Victor Hugo *metro station*) can never be promoted."
