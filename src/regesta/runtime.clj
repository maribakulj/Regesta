(ns regesta.runtime
  "Rule execution engine.

   Applies a compiled rule set to a record, collects productions
   (assertions, diagnostics, repair proposals, projection intents), and
   merges them back into the record with full provenance traceability.

   Runtime contract (ADR 0004, ADR 0020):
   - Rules execute only in their declared phase.
   - Each phase is a single pass: every rule whose :phase matches fires
     once, against the record as it entered the phase. There is no
     multi-cycle iteration and no fixpoint in V1 — chained inference is
     expressed by ordering rules across phases.
   - Productions are deduplicated at merge by structural identity
     (ADR 0008), so two rules deriving the same fact in one pass collapse.
   - Every merged assertion / diagnostic carries provenance pointing to
     the rule and phase that produced it (set by the rule compiler).

   What the runtime merges:
   - `:assertion` productions → appended to `record[:assertions]`.
   - `:diagnostic` productions → appended to `record[:diagnostics]`.
   - `:entity` productions → appended to `record[:entities]`, deduplicated by
     id (ADR 0014/0017). A re-mint of the same content-derived id is a no-op.
   - `:repair` productions → not merged into the record in V1; authors
     that want repairs attached to a diagnostic place them inline in
     the diagnostic template's `:repairs` vector. Standalone repairs
     stay accessible via the returned `:productions` trace.

   Out of scope in this engine:
   - Cross-record execution, retract semantics, convergence detection,
     projection."
