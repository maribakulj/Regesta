  "Validation gate — the *mechanism* an institution gates an ingest on: import a
   source, normalise it to the canonical floor, run the canonical `:validate` rule
   set (ADR 0003), and return the diagnostics with a pass/fail verdict under a
   failure policy. The reusable pipeline (import → normalize → validate → policy)
   is the deliverable; the rule *content* is whatever the canonical plugin ships
   (V1: one rule, `:title-required` — the set grows by justified need, ADR 0003).

   Validity is **not** loss. A record can be `VALID` here and still have lost
   fields in conversion — that is a separate, fully-modelled concern (ADR 0015,
   reported by `regesta.convert` / `regesta.loss-report`); this answers only \"does
   the canonical record satisfy the rules?\". Reads the source-spoke registry from
   `regesta.spokes` (no dependency on the export stack)."
