  "Repair-application / curation engine — the ADR 0005 `apply-repairs` workflow as
   a pure, auditable function over a record's *pending* assertions.

   A pipeline's `:infer`/`:repair` phases emit assertions as `:proposed` (the
   string-key WEMI inference in `regesta.plugins.lrmoo.project`, the creator-only
   Work in `intermarc.frbrise`, the fuzzy reconciliation tier of ADR 0018): claims
   the machine generated but did not auto-confirm. Curation is the human (or
   policy) step that resolves each pending claim into the *workflow* family
   (ADR 0005):

     :accept → :accepted     :reject → :rejected     :review → :needs-review

   `decide` is the curator: `(fn [assertion] -> :accept | :reject | :review)`. The
   named `accept-all` / `reject-all` / `flag-all` / `accept-when` policies are
   ordinary decision functions, so an ADR 0018 promotion guard composes —
   `(accept-when certifiable?)` accepts only the proposals safe to commit and
   routes the rest (the Victor-Hugo-metro-station match) to review, never silently.

   It is a pure function of (record, decision): no clock, no I/O, deterministic, so
   it is re-runnable and testable. Curation acts only on *pending* assertions
   (`:proposed` or `:needs-review`); everything in force or already resolved is
   left untouched. The transition log it returns is the audit record — the
   Provenance schema deliberately does not model a from→to history (ADR 0005 keeps
   the decision in `:status`), so curation *reports* transitions rather than
   stamping them.

   Out of scope here (documented, not done): supersession of an in-force assertion
   that an accepted proposal replaces (ADR 0005's conditional \"may cause the
   original to become :superseded\"). It needs replacement semantics the proposal
   does not yet carry — the core models no predicate cardinality, so the engine
   cannot tell a correction from an addition. Left to a later, explicit step."
