# Architecture Decision Records

Structural decisions that shape the Regesta core. Each ADR is a standalone
document: context, decision, consequences. New major decisions get their own
ADR; supersessions are explicit, not silent edits.

**Status convention.** Status records the *decision*, not the build. An accepted
decision may be only partly implemented; where the gap is material the ADR carries
an `## Implementation status` section listing what is built vs decided-but-unbuilt,
and the index below is annotated *"partially implemented — see ADR"*. This keeps a
decision from being read as shipped code (an audit honesty rule).

## Template

New ADRs follow this skeleton:

```markdown
# NNNN — Title

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by NNNN
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What problem are we facing? What are the constraints?

## Decision
What did we choose? Stated plainly.

## Alternatives considered
Briefly, what else was on the table and why it was rejected.

## Consequences
What becomes easier. What becomes harder. What future decisions are gated on this.
```
