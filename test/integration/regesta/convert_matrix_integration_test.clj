  "Hardening: the full 5×8 conversion matrix on real fixtures. Proves the
   assembly composes universally — every source spoke × every target serialisation
   runs without throwing and yields an ADR 0015 loss report — and documents the
   one honest degenerate case.

   The WEMI/CRM/Linked-Art targets read `:lrmoo/*` and work for every spoke; the
   round-trip exporters (`dc`, `marc21`) read `:canon/*`, which every spoke —
   INTERMARC included, since it now normalises to the floor alongside `frbrise` —
   populates."
