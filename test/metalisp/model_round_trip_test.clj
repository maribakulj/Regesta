  "Generative EDN round-trip test for the canonical model.

   For every major schema we generate N samples and assert that
   `(edn/read-string (pr-str sample))` equals `sample`. This is the
   load-bearing property of Sprint 1: the IR is pure data and serializes
   without loss.

   The :double leaf of `Primitive` uses `:gen/fmap` in the model to clamp
   NaN/Infinity to 0.0 at generation time, so round-trip equality holds
   for every generated sample without extra filtering."
