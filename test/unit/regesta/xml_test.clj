  "Pins the input-hardening posture of `regesta.xml` (WP-9 security): every XML
   importer parses through this façade, which refuses DTDs (`:support-dtd false`).
   That single policy closes two real holes verified against `clojure.data.xml`:

   - the `billion laughs` entity-expansion DoS (the baseline parser expands a
     tiny nested-entity payload unbounded — the JDK limit does not fire), and
   - any DTD-borne XXE (external entities are already unresolved by data.xml, but
     a DTD is their only vehicle, so refusing it removes the surface entirely).

   The throw happens while the lazy tree is *realised*, so every assertion below
   forces the whole tree (`realize`) rather than trusting the bare parse call —
   a parse that is never walked never advances past the `<!DOCTYPE>`."
