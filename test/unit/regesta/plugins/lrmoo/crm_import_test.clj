  "CRM → LRM round-trip (ADR 0019): the directionality rule, demonstrated on our
   own exports rather than asserted. A WEMI record (F1 Work, F2 Expression, F3
   Manifestation + R3/R4) is exported two ways and read back:

   - via the **additive** `:crm` view (which keeps the LRMoo F-classes) → the
     downcast recovers F1/F2/F3 *exactly* — lossless;
   - via the **pure** `:crm-only` view (F2/F3 both flattened to E73) → the Expression
     and Manifestation can no longer be distinguished — the downcast collapses into
     `:ambiguity-collapsed`, precisely the loss `crm/crm-only-losses` reported on the
     way down.

   No external data: the CRM is produced by our own exporter."
