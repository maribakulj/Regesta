(ns regesta.eval.loc-xslt
  "Shared offline runner for the Library of Congress crosswalk stylesheets used as
   conversion *oracles* (`MARC21slim2OAIDC`, `MARC21slim2MODS3-1`). Runs a vendored,
   unmodified LoC stylesheet through the JDK's built-in XSLT 1.0 engine (no added
   dependency).

   One offline concession, common to both crosswalks: their absolute
   `xsl:import`/`xsl:include` of `MARC21slimUtils.xsl` (an loc.gov URL that is 403 in
   the sandbox) is redirected to the locally-vendored copy via a `URIResolver`. Two
   JDK XML processing limits are pinned so the transform behaves identically across
   the CI JDK matrix (21/24) rather than depending on a runner's defaults:

   - `accessExternalStylesheet = all` — permit the (now-local) import;
   - `jdk.xml.xpathExprOpLimit = 0` — the 99 KB MODS stylesheet contains a
     101-operator XPath union (a long `marc:datafield[@tag=…]|…` list) that trips the
     default per-expression cap of 100. These are trusted LoC stylesheets, so the
     cap is lifted rather than worked around."
