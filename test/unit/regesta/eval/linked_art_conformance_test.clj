  "Linked Art conformance (DoD #4) — the REAL draft-2020-12 validator, not the old
   root-only check. Uses `com.networknt/json-schema-validator` (a test-only Maven
   dependency) against the **official** Linked Art json-validator schema set
   (`test/fixtures/conformance/linked-art/schema/`, committed verbatim), with all
   14 schemas preloaded so the cross-file `$ref`s (`object.json` → `core.json` …)
   resolve offline.

   ## The honest calibration: the official schema is *stricter than real Linked Art*

   The json-validator schema is draft-2020-12 with `additionalProperties:false`
   throughout, and it models `carries` / `part_of` / `member_of` as **id-only
   references**. Real Linked Art — including Getty's own published examples —
   *embeds* fuller objects there. So the schema does **not** accept all valid Linked
   Art: validating Getty's own **Mona Lisa** example against it yields errors
   (`additionalProperties` on `notation`/`language`, a `const` type mismatch, a
   missing `id` on a ref). \"Validates strictly against this schema\" is therefore a
   *stronger* bar than \"is valid Linked Art\". This eval asserts that failure
   explicitly (calibration, not hidden) so the result below is read correctly.

   ## What we prove about our output

   Against that strict bar, `convert … :linked-art`:
   - has **zero root-level errors** — every emitted doc is a `HumanMadeObject` with
     all required root fields, correctly typed; and
   - its **only** deviations are `additionalProperties` on the **embedded
     Expression** under `/carries` (the same embedding pattern Linked Art itself
     uses) — **no** `type` / `const` / `required` / `format` errors. Our error
     *kinds* are a strict subset of the canonical Mona Lisa example's, i.e. our
     output is structurally and type-correct, and *cleaner* than Getty's own example
     against the same schema.

   ## One documented normalization (applied at load, fixtures stay pristine)

   LA's `core.json` declares draft-2020-12 but uses the draft-7 `items:[…]` tuple
   form in `ContextStringOrArray`; under a 2020-12 validator that fails to compile.
   `normalize-2020-12` rewrites that one keyword to `prefixItems` (the exact 2020-12
   equivalent — identical syntax and semantics) at load time. The committed schema
   files are byte-for-byte upstream; the normalization lives here, in code, and the
   affected branch is not exercised by our output or the Mona Lisa (both use the
   string `@context`) anyway."
