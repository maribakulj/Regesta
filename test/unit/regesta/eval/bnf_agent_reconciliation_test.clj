  "Eval (ADR 0018, certified tier) on real BnF data: 100 INTERMARC records returned
   by `bib.author all \"victor hugo\"` / `\"jules verne\"`, reconciled by ISNI.

   The headline is not a low agent count — it is *precision by construction*. The
   search string matches a dozen distinct people (the novelist Jules Verne vs his
   biographer Jean Jules-Verne; Victor Hugo's grandson and son; Latin-American
   authors named \"Víctor Hugo …\"); keying on the authority id keeps them apart,
   where a name match would conflate them. And a name-only \"Victor Hugo\" — the
   namesake / Paris metro-station case — never enters the certified set.
   See `test/fixtures/er-gold/bnf-agents/README.md`."
