  "Convergence eval via the LoC MARC→MODS oracle (DoD #1 / the hub-and-spoke thesis).
   Not a differential of element coverage (that is the DC oracle); this asks the
   convergence question directly: *the same MARC record, routed two independent
   ways into the canonical hub, should land in the same place on the documentary
   spine.*

   - **Path A** — MARC21 → Regesta's MARC21 importer → canonical floor.
   - **Path B** — MARC21 → the Library of Congress' own `MARC21slim2MODS3-1.xsl`
     (run as an oracle, JDK XSLT 1.0) → real MODS → Regesta's MODS importer →
     canonical floor.

   Path B is the strong test: the intermediary is a *third party's* standard
   (authoritative MODS, not our hand-written fixtures), and it exercises the MODS
   importer against `nonSort`/`title` splits, typed `namePart`s, a `modsCollection`
   wrapper, and dual `dateIssued` — shapes our fixtures only approximated.

   ## What converges (the spine survives the detour)

   - **title — exactly, both records.** This is non-trivial: MODS splits the article
     into `<nonSort>The </nonSort><title>Great Ray Charles</title>`, and the importer's
     nonSort restoration reconstructs precisely the inline MARC 245 \"The Great Ray
     Charles\". Without that restoration the two routes would *not* converge.
   - **the bibliographic identifier (LCCN)** and **the transcribed date** appear in
     both routes, both records.
   - **digital objects** (the 856 access URLs) converge exactly for the web record.

   ## What diverges (MODS carries more, and flattens differently) — asserted, not hidden

   - **agent.** Path B folds the date `namePart` into the name (\"Charles, Ray 1930-\")
     *and* promotes `originInfo/publisher` to a second agent (\"Atlantic\"); Path A
     keeps only the 700 $a name. Two defensible flattenings of one MARC record.
   - **date.** Path B also carries the MARC-*coded* normalised form (\"1957\";
     \"1994\"/\"9999\") that the LoC stylesheet emits as a second `dateIssued`; Path A
     has only the transcribed 260 $c.
   - **identifier.** Path B adds the 028 issue number (\"1259 Atlantic\", MODS
     `type=\"issue number\"`) and the 856 URLs (MODS `type=\"uri\"`); Path A keys on the
     control numbers (035) and routes 856 $u to a digital object, not an identifier.
   - **note.** Path A keeps the 505 track listing; the LoC stylesheet routes it to
     `<tableOfContents>`, which the MODS floor does not map (ADR 0003) → dropped in B.

   Honest framing: this is convergence on the *documentary spine through an external
   standard*, **not** round-trip equality — the two importers have different scopes
   and MODS is the richer interchange format. The eval asserts both the convergence
   and the divergences, on real LoC output."
