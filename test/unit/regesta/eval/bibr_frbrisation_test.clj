  "Independent FRBRisation eval — Regesta's MARC21 → WEMI Work clustering measured
   against the **BIB-R** benchmark gold (a third-party 'Benchmark of FRBRization
   solutions', bib-r.github.io, CC BY-NC). See `test/fixtures/bibr-gold/README.md`
   for provenance, derivation and licence.

   Why this matters: `docs/eval/frbrisation-fidelity.md` records that the C2 score
   is high only because the gold (`workManifested`) and the input (`f145 $3`) are
   two serialisations of the *same* BnF link — a transcription check, not evidence
   of inference — and closes with: 'Independent evaluation of bridging will need a
   gold that is **not derived from f145/workManifested**.' BIB-R is exactly that: a
   hand-curated MARC → FRBR/RDA gold with zero dependence on any link Regesta reads.

   What it measures: Regesta projects flat MARC21 to WEMI by the *floor* rung
   (`lrmoo.project`), whose Work key is `agent + norm(uniform-title when present,
   else transcribed-245-title)` — a Work is minted only when a creator is present.
   The BIB-R gold groups by the cataloguer's *uniform* work (its work URIs are
   author+uniform-title slugs), so it unifies transcribed-title **variants**,
   translations and integral/abridged editions under one Work. So this is a genuine,
   non-circular recall test of the uniform-title bridging (the MARC 240 step):
   where editions of one Work share a uniform title, the key now unifies them; the
   residual gap is the uniform titles that are themselves inconsistent or absent.

   Honest scope (stated, not hidden): the MARC `001`s carry no link to the gold's
   title-slug URIs, so records are joined to the gold **by normalised title**, and a
   record whose title the gold spreads across several works is *excluded* (the gold
   itself fragments e.g. La Fontaine's Fables across work URIs). The metric is
   therefore over the cleanly-joinable subset; the join coverage is reported as a
   first-class number, not buried."
