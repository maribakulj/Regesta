(ns regesta.integration-test
  "End-to-end integration tests: build a small set of input records, define
   rules across multiple phases, run the pipeline, and verify the resulting
   IR end-to-end (assertions, diagnostics, status, provenance, repairs,
   trace, dedup, consistency).

   The scenario is a tiny library-catalog ingestion. It exercises the pieces
   the V1 core ships: record construction, rule compilation, multi-phase
   pipeline, dedup at merge (ADR 0008), :proposed status on infer-phase
   assertions (ADR 0005), provenance deep-merge (engine fields authoritative),
   and the diagnostics query API.

   Importer / exporter / mapping integration is deliberately out of scope
   here — those land with Sprint 5+. When they do, this test grows a
   sibling that begins with `(plugins/import ...)` and ends with
   `(plugins/export ...)`."
